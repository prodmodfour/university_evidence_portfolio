### **Summary: Understanding Your Portfolio for Endpoint Assessment**

**Purpose of Session:**
To help apprentices understand their **Endpoint Assessment (EPA)**, the **layout and design of their portfolio**, the **timeline for submission**, and to create a **plan** for completing the process on time.

---

### **1. Gateway and EPA Overview**

* The **Gateway** meeting (with your Skills Coach and Line Manager) determines if you’re ready for your EPA.
* To pass Gateway, you must:

  * Submit a **portfolio of evidence** (the focus of this session).
  * Complete and pass all degree components (except EPA).
  * Have evidence recorded on **Smart Assessor**.
  * Submit a **project title and summary** (approved by the Independent Assessor).

---

### **2. EPA Timeline**

* **End of January (final year):** Submit your portfolio, signed off by your Skills Coach.
* **Start of February:** Gateway meeting and project proposal submission.
* **Feb–May:** Complete project, report, and presentation (12 weeks).
* **Mid-May:** EPA booked (two weeks’ notice).
* **Early June:** EPA takes place → grades sent to exam board → graduation eligibility confirmed.

### **3. Portfolio of Evidence**

* Must demonstrate required **Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs)**.

* There are **six key themes**, each with subtopics.

* Evidence must come from **on-programme activity** (not before or after Gateway).

* Focus on **quality over quantity**—substantial, relevant pieces of evidence are preferred.

* Possible evidence types:

  * Workplace documents, policies, records, or meeting notes
  * Witness statements
  * Academic assignments
  * Annotated work
  * Video clips (max 10 minutes total)

* Each piece of evidence must be **mapped** to the appropriate KSBs.

* Use a **Reflection on Evidence** document and a **PowerPoint per theme** to help review and identify gaps.

---

### **4. Progress and Planning by Year**

* **Year 1:** Focus on core principles and introductory KSBs.
* **Year 2:** Pathway-specific modules; aim to complete three themes.
* **Years 3–4:** Continue gathering workplace-based evidence for remaining themes.
* Maintain a **KSB tracker** to monitor progress and identify gaps.
* Submit evidence each year to show **continuous development**.

---

### **5. Submission and Assessment Preparation**

* **Final submission (end of January):** Upload all evidence to Smart Assessor or OneDrive.
* After submission, no amendments can be made.
* Evidence is used to create **bespoke EPA questions**.
* Prepare for the professional discussion with:

  * Mock questions
  * Line manager reviews
  * Progress reviews
  * Upcoming **AI mock exam generator** (to be introduced)

---

### **6. Example Portfolio Guidance**

* Each theme should include:

  * Theme title and mapped KSBs
  * Substantial evidence (e.g., induction meetings, training certificates, data analysis work, coursework, tickets)
  * Explanations and impact reflections
* Ensure **GDPR compliance** by redacting sensitive data.
* End each theme with a reflection or review slide.

---

### **7. Final Advice**

* Keep separate folders for each theme.
* Upload evidence by deadlines set by your Skills Coach.
* Work closely with your Skills Coach and Line Manager to plan and review progress.
* Ask questions early to stay on track for Gateway and graduation.
