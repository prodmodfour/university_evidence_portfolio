# What is this?

This portfolio was created as part of my Digital Technology and Solutions degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. It shows evidence for each KSB (Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours) that I have achieved during my studies.

# Where can I see the KSBS?
You can see the KSBs in this pdf document: [DTS KSBs](Data_Analytics_KSB_Themes.pdf)

# How to use this repository
The portfolio is seperated into the six themes of the DTS degree. Each folder is a slidev project. In order to view the slides, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate to the folder of the theme you want to view using `cd <folder-name>`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the Slidev presentation by running `npx slidev --open`.
5. The presentation should open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3030`.
